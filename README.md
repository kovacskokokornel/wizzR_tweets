# wizzR_tweets
Quantitative text analysis on how Wizzair tweeted (treated, If I may) customers during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Notes
  - The same Python twitter package limits to a download of 200 entries, hence the switching back and forth.
  - No twitter package seems to have a function to download `conversations` by id, hence the trick with selenium.
  - I know excel export is sort of disgusting. Forgive for that.
